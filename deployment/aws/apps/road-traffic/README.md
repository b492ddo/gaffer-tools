# Deploying the Road Traffic example on AWS

This directory contains a CloudFormation template and script that can be used to deploy the [Road Traffic example](https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/tree/master/example/road-traffic) onto infrastructure provided by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

The template can be uploaded to the [CloudFormation web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) or, if you have the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed, you can use the deployment script in this directory.
